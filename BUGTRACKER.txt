  Unknown metadata for some known data at given position
    Reproduced: when applying world_modifications in the generate_chunk function
    Reason: world_modifications generates structures that overextend outside the chunk, which do
not have any metadata equivalent
    Solution: ignore those blocks lol

  Some mobs not updating
    Reproduced: when the mobs are too deep underground
    Reason: the mobs belong to a chunk, so when the chunk doesn't update anymore,
the mobs don't either
    Solution: save mobs in a globa list rather than in a list per chunk
  
  You cannot break some blocks
	Reproduced: the blocks have to be extending out of a chunk border
	Reason: because of the way world generation works, the blocks can be placed outside a chunk.
Whenever you click on it, the game detects it and thinks that you want the block at that position, which
is another block in another chunk.
    Solution: in progress
